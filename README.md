Backend project in nodejs/typescript and express and mysql

## Description

This is a small boilerplate of a backend project which I've used in one of my commercial projects.
For indepth view in a larger project, kindly look into api.funkaarts.com repository.
I've used typescript here and for deployment I deploy the complied javascript folder which the typescript compiler outputs. I've used mysql as my primary database with firebase auth for user authentication. 

Note: If you try to run the project by installing the packages only then it may not work. I've removed all connection strings and sensitive information that was need to connect the app. However you can put your own connection strings and you're good to go.


### Installing

* npm install
* add connection strings that are missing
